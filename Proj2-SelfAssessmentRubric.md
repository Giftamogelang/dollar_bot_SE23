| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly in GH | https://github.com/aditikilledar/dollar_bot_SE23/tree/main  | 3      |

| Docs: why - docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |   | 1 |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code |  | 1 |

| Use of code formatters - config files in GH showing your this formatter's config | | 2  |
| Use of syntax checkers - config files in GH showing this checker's config | | 2 |
| Use of code coverage - config files in GH |        https://github.com/aditikilledar/dollar_bot_SE23/blob/main/.codecov.yml.coverage file exists                | 3      |

| Test cases exist - dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base | |2 |
| Test cases are routinely executed - E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something | Travis CI used. | 3 |
| **Collaboration**                  |                                                              |        |
| The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up |https://github.com/aditikilledar/dollar_bot_SE23/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md |3 |
| Issues are discussed before they are closed - even if you discuss in slack, need a summary statement here |   | 0
| Chat channel: exists - Link or screenshots |https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yVlqYdZ3ZScGU9_xKBDtW26CA2zcaObO?usp=sharing                | 0     |
| Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it |  | 2
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files |  | 3
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) |  | 0
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer) | - | 0
| Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base | |3 |
| Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work |https://github.com/aditikilledar/dollar_bot_SE23/releases/tag/v0.1.0  | 3
